                A car rally fundraiser can be run in two different formats, each with differing levels of work required for their success. This format takes an incredible amount of work to ensure its success. A Multi-day Car Rally can be run similar to the famous “Bourke Bash”; stopping at country towns in dressed up cars that can help attract attention and fundraising along the route.
            </p>
            <p class="padd_class">
                This format is much more manageable for clubs to undertake on their own. Club members and friends are encouraged to join forces in a car, travel to various destinations and undertake a variety of tasks. Points and prizes are awarded for the winners.
            </p>
            <p class="padd_class">
                A Car Rally has a set course to navigate over a day with tasks to be completed at each checkpoint. Clues are picked up from checkpoints that will lead the driver and team to their next destination and task. Tasks and clues can be as creative as you like… Puzzles, flags, riddles.

            <p class="p_medium">We are a group of people who are trying to do better. The future of media is one that is disruptive, agile, and credible. It embraces diversity, and leaves its audience in a better place than where they were before. We advocate for a media that embraces this and we embody this in our own identity. We build, operate and invest in distinct media brands that produce ground-breaking content and media solutions for a South Asian audience. We works on the front lines in 150+ locations across six regions. </p>

            <p class="p_medium padd_class">There’s a strong chance I buy a ticket and just go with you. That’s how badly I want to be together. Please have a safe journey. If you’re nervous on your journey, just think about me because I will absolutely be thinking about you. Travel safe, darling. Good drivers who obey traffic laws and avoid distractions can significantly reduce their risk of being involved in a crash. I wish you didn’t have to go so soon but I am so glad for the time we had together. Have a safe journey! See ya later, Alligator!</p>

                Sports Community provide training and knowledge, both in person and online, to clubs and their volunteers. We also offer consulting services to peak sporting bodies and local councils. This hasn’t held us back – we have worked with people from all over Australia – from Exmouth in WA, to inner-city Sydney, coastal Victoria to the deserts of Alice Springs.

                We are a group of prople who are trying to do better. If that sounds like you, then we have some good news: you’re probably right. Windows has a tendency to slow down over time, so if your computer was running OK before, but has now slowed to a crawl, it’s probably a Windows issue, and you should be able to fix it yourself.
